# Binary Search Algorithm in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script, `binary_alg.py`, that implements the binary search algorithm. The script includes both an iterative and a recursive approach to binary search, along with 10 examples that demonstrate how to use each version.

Binary search is an efficient algorithm for finding an item in a sorted list. It works by repeatedly dividing the search interval in half, making it much faster than linear search, especially for large datasets.

## File Contents

- **`binary_alg.py`**: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the binary search algorithm along with examples.

## Functions

### Iterative Binary Search

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    """
    Performs a binary search on the provided sorted list 'arr' to find the 'target'.
    Returns the index of the target if found, else returns -1.
    """
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A sorted list of elements to search through.
  - `target`: The element you are searching for in the list.

- **Returns**:
  - The index of `target` if it is found in the list.
  - `-1` if the `target` is not found.

### Recursive Binary Search

```python
def recursive_binary_search(arr, target, left, right):
    """
    Recursively performs a binary search on the provided sorted list 'arr' to find the 'target'.
    Returns the index of the target if found, else returns -1.
    """
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A sorted list of elements to search through.
  - `target`: The element you are searching for in the list.
  - `left`: The left boundary of the current search interval.
  - `right`: The right boundary of the current search interval.

- **Returns**:
  - The index of `target` if it is found in the list.
  - `-1` if the `target` is not found.

## Examples

The script includes 10 examples that demonstrate how to use both the iterative and recursive binary search functions. These examples cover various scenarios, such as:

1. Finding the target at the beginning, middle, or end of the list.
2. Handling cases where the target is not present in the list.
3. Working with different data types like integers and strings.
4. Dealing with edge cases like an empty list or a single element list.

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. It will execute the examples and print the results to the console.

   ```bash
   python binary_alg.py
   ```

2. **Modify Examples**: You can add more examples or modify existing ones by editing the `examples` list within the script.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: This script requires Python 3.x to run.

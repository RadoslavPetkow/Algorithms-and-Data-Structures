# Recursive Binary Search Algorithm in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that implements the recursive binary search algorithm. Binary search is an efficient algorithm used to find an element in a sorted list. The recursive approach to binary search involves dividing the list in half and recursively searching in the appropriate half until the target value is found or the search interval is exhausted.

## File Contents

- **`binary_search.py`**: The main Python script that contains the implementation of the recursive binary search algorithm, along with 10 examples demonstrating its usage.

## Function

### `recursive_binary_search(arr, target, left, right)`

```python
def recursive_binary_search(arr, target, left, right):
    """
    Recursively performs a binary search on the provided sorted list 'arr' to find the 'target'.
    Returns the index of the target if found, else returns -1.
    """
    if right >= left:
        mid = left + (right - left) // 2

        # Check if the target is present at mid
        if arr[mid] == target:
            return mid
        # If the target is greater, search the right half
        elif arr[mid] < target:
            return recursive_binary_search(arr, target, mid + 1, right)
        # If the target is smaller, search the left half
        else:
            return recursive_binary_search(arr, target, left, mid - 1)

    # Target was not present in the array
    return -1
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A sorted list of elements to search through.
  - `target`: The element you are searching for in the list.
  - `left`: The left boundary of the current search interval.
  - `right`: The right boundary of the current search interval.

- **Returns**:
  - The index of `target` if it is found in the list.
  - `-1` if the `target` is not found.

### `binary_search(arr, target)`

```python
def binary_search(arr, target):
    return recursive_binary_search(arr, target, 0, len(arr) - 1)
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A sorted list of elements to search through.
  - `target`: The element you are searching for in the list.

- **Returns**:
  - The index of `target` if it is found in the list.
  - `-1` if the `target` is not found.

This function serves as a wrapper that initiates the recursive binary search with the entire array as the search interval.

## Examples

The script includes 10 examples that demonstrate how to use the `binary_search` function. These examples cover various scenarios such as:

1. **Finding the Target**:
    - In the middle of the list.
    - At the beginning of the list.
    - At the end of the list.
  
2. **Handling Special Cases**:
    - When the target is not found in the list.
    - When the list is empty.
    - When all elements in the list are the same as the target (finding the first occurrence).
    - When the list contains different data types, like strings.
    - When the list has only one element.

### Example Output

The script will print the result of each example directly to the console. Here is what the output might look like:

```bash
Example 1: Target '3' found at index 2 in list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Example 2: Target '10' found at index 0 in list [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
Example 3: Target '500' found at index 4 in list [100, 200, 300, 400, 500].
Example 4: Target '7' not found in list [5, 10, 15, 20, 25].
...
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. It will execute the examples and print the results to the console.

   ```bash
   python binary_search.py
   ```

2. **Modify Examples**: You can add more examples or modify existing ones by editing the `examples` list within the script.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: This script requires Python 3.x to run.

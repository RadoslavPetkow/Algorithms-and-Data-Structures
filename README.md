# Algorithms and Data Structures Repository

Welcome to the **Algorithms and Data Structures** repository! This is a collection of various algorithms and data structures that I've been learning and exploring. I find these topics fascinating and thought it would be cool to save and share them here.

## Introduction

This repository is a personal project where I document the algorithms and data structures I've learned. It includes well-known algorithms, data structures, and some that are less common but equally interesting. Each algorithm and data structure is explained with examples and, when possible, implemented in code.

## Why This Repository

Learning algorithms and data structures is crucial for anyone interested in computer science, software development, or problem-solving in general. By saving and organizing these concepts, I can revisit them whenever I need to, and others who stumble upon this repository can learn from it as well.

## Contents

Here's a brief overview of what you'll find in this repository:


- **Searching Algorithms**
  - Binary Search
  - Linear Search
  - Recursive Binary Search

-** I will add many more soon <:

Each algorithm and data structure comes with:

- **Explanation:** A detailed explanation of how it works.
- **Complexity Analysis:** An analysis of time and space complexity.
- **Code Implementation:** A sample implementation in a programming language (e.g., Python, C++, Java).
- **Examples:** Example use cases to demonstrate how it can be applied.

## How to Use

1. **Clone the Repository:**
   ```bash
   git clone https://github.com/yourusername/algorithms-data-structures.git
   ```
   
2. **Navigate through the folders:** Each folder is dedicated to a specific topic, with code and explanations.
   
3. **Run the Code:** You can run the code examples directly or modify them to see how changes affect the results.

4. **Learn and Contribute:** This repository is a learning resource. Feel free to study the code, improve it, or add new algorithms and data structures.

## Contributing

Contributions are welcome! If you have an algorithm or data structure you'd like to add, or if you want to improve existing content, please follow these steps:

1. Fork the repository.
2. Create a new branch (`git checkout -b new-feature`).
3. Make your changes and commit them (`git commit -m 'Add new feature'`).
4. Push to the branch (`git push origin new-feature`).
5. Create a pull request.

Please make sure your contributions are well-documented and tested.

Certainly! Below is a `README.md` file for the provided `linear_search.py` script.

# Linear Search Algorithm in Python

## Overview

This repository contains a Python script that implements the linear search algorithm. Linear search is a straightforward algorithm that checks each element in a list sequentially until it finds the target element or exhausts the list.

## File Contents

- **`linear_search.py`**: The Python script that contains the implementation of the linear search algorithm along with 10 examples demonstrating its usage.

## Function

### `linear_search(arr, target)`

```python
def linear_search(arr, target):
    """
    Performs a linear search on the provided list 'arr' to find the 'target'.
    Returns the index of the target if found, else returns -1.
    """
    for i in range(len(arr)):
        if arr[i] == target:
            return i
    return -1
```

- **Parameters**:
  - `arr`: A list of elements to search through.
  - `target`: The element you are searching for in the list.

- **Returns**:
  - The index of `target` if it is found in the list.
  - `-1` if the `target` is not found.

## Examples

The script includes 10 examples that demonstrate how to use the `linear_search` function. These examples cover various scenarios such as:

1. **Finding the Target**: 
    - In the middle of the list.
    - At the beginning of the list.
    - At the end of the list.
  
2. **Handling Special Cases**:
    - When the target is not found in the list.
    - When the list is empty.
    - When all elements in the list are the same as the target.
    - When the list contains different data types, like strings.
    - When the list has only one element.

### Example Output

The script will print the result of each example directly to the console. Here is what the output might look like:

```bash
Example 1: Target '3' found at index 2 in list [1, 2, 3, 4, 5].
Example 2: Target '10' found at index 0 in list [10, 20, 30, 40, 50].
Example 3: Target '500' found at index 4 in list [100, 200, 300, 400, 500].
Example 4: Target '7' not found in list [5, 10, 15, 20, 25].
...
```

## How to Use

1. **Run the Script**: You can run the script directly using Python. It will execute the examples and print the results to the console.

   ```bash
   python linear_search.py
   ```

2. **Modify Examples**: You can add more examples or modify existing ones by editing the `examples` list within the script.

## Requirements

- **Python 3.x**: This script requires Python 3.x to run.
